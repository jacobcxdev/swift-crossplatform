# Roadmap: Swift Cross-Platform

## Overview

This roadmap delivers TCA on Android via Skip Fuse mode. The observation bridge is the critical-path foundation -- every subsequent phase depends on it. From there, we build upward through foundation libraries, TCA core, state/bindings, navigation, database, and finally integration testing with documentation. Each phase delivers a coherent, testable capability that unblocks the next.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Observation Bridge** - Native Swift Observation works correctly on Android with record-replay pattern preventing infinite recomposition
- [ ] **Phase 2: Foundation Libraries** - CasePaths, IdentifiedCollections, CustomDump, and IssueReporting work on Android
- [x] **Phase 3: TCA Core** - Store, reducers, effects, and dependency injection work on Android (completed 2026-02-22)

- [x] **Phase 7: Integration Testing & Documentation** - End-to-end TCA app runs on both platforms; forks documented (completed 2026-02-22)

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Observation Bridge
**Goal**: Swift Observation semantics work correctly on Android -- view body evaluation triggers exactly one recomposition per observation cycle, not one per mutation
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: OBS-01, OBS-02, OBS-03, OBS-04, OBS-05, OBS-06, OBS-07, OBS-08, OBS-09, OBS-10, OBS-11, OBS-12, OBS-13, OBS-14, OBS-15, OBS-16, OBS-17, OBS-18, OBS-19, OBS-20, OBS-21, OBS-22, OBS-23, OBS-24, OBS-25, OBS-26, OBS-27, OBS-28, OBS-29, OBS-30, SPM-01, SPM-02, SPM-03, SPM-04, SPM-05, SPM-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. An `@Observable` class property mutation in a view model triggers exactly one Compose recomposition (not hundreds) on Android
  2. Nested parent/child view hierarchies each independently track their own observed properties on Android
  3. `ViewModifier` bodies participate in observation tracking the same as `View` bodies on Android
  4. Bridge initialization failure produces a fatal error (crash with clear message) instead of silently falling back to broken counter-based observation
  5. All 17 fork packages compile for Android via Skip Fuse mode with correct SPM configuration
**Plans**: 2 plans in 2 waves

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md -- Bridge implementation fixes, diagnostics API, and observation tests (OBS-01 through OBS-30) ✓ 2026-02-21
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md -- SPM compilation validation for all 14 forks and Android emulator integration tests (SPM-01 through SPM-06) ✓ 2026-02-21
