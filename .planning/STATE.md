# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-20)

**Core value:** Any TCA app built with Point-Free's tools must run correctly on both iOS and Android via Skip's Fuse mode, with identical observation semantics and no infinite recomposition loops.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Observation Bridge

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Observation Bridge)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-21 -- Roadmap created with 7 phases covering 184 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Fuse mode only (no Lite) for TCA apps -- counter-based observation incompatible
- Fix at bridge level (skip-android-bridge/skip-ui), not app level
- Use native `withObservationTracking` (not swift-perception) -- `libswiftObservation.so` ships with Android SDK
- Fork-first, upstream later -- Skip team endorsed this approach

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Navigation on Android: `NavigationStack.init(path:root:destination:)` is fully guarded out on Android -- need to determine skip-ui Compose equivalent (affects Phase 5)
- `jniContext` thread attachment: verify `AttachCurrentThread()` handling for non-main threads (affects TCA effects in Phase 3)
- `swiftThreadingFatal` stub required until Swift 6.3 ships upstream fix (PR #77890)
